                    <p>We’ve written a helpful article that lists the federal payroll forms for new businesses — there are even download links. And these are exactly the types of forms you can digitally sign and store on Gusto, so you’ll know they’re in one, easy-to-access place.</p>

                        Keep in mind, while managing your benefits on Gusto is free, offerings like traditional health insurance or 401(k)s will require monthly fees or premiums. <br><br>
                        
                        But some benefits don’t cost anything extra, like our financial planning tools for employees. Adding these benefits is a no brainer for employers who want to take care of their team beyond the workplace.</p>

                    Yes! If you prefer paper checks instead of direct deposits, we’ll give you a template to print those paystubs yourself.<br><br>
                    
                    Quick tip: If you have employees interested in setting up bank accounts, employees can use Gusto Wallet to have their wages deposited into a simple cash account with a debit card. It’s a free financial planning tool and helps your team get access to their money quickly and easily.<br><br>

                    <h2>Can I set up automatic payroll each month?</h2>
                  <p>Yes! A lot of small businesses with straightforward wages use our Payroll on AutoPilot™ feature. You just set your employees’ hours and wages or salary amount and when they should be paid, then we process payroll for you automatically every month. It’s a great way to avoid stress and save time. Plus, we’ll even send you a reminder one day before, in case you want to make changes.</p>
